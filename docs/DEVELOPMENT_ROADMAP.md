# Genesis v2.0 transition and mandatory release scope

> **Live-state precedence:** This roadmap preserves dated historical planning snapshots. As of audited `main` `3d43a94fbf494360dfec1e7fb852cc99100d51eb`, the native graph is 34 tasks / 69 edges; F00-PLAN #8 and F00-V0 #9 were accepted, and Alperen Enes Yaman is the active owner for F02-CONTRACT #11 (implementation NOT_STARTED). Always re-fetch current `main`, registry, acceptance and Issue #11 before a new task. Approved SRS remains v0.4.0. Follow the [Codex-native protocol and activation conditions](governance/PROJECT_GENESIS_CODEX_NATIVE_PROTOCOL_V3.md) for execution governance. Dated approval and assignment statements below record their historical policy and state.

Owner decision (2026-10-27): 31 existing technical issues and 54 original dependencies are retained, with three new unassigned P0 issues (#40–#42) and a staged 34-task / 69-edge dependency graph, but fixed implementation assignments are removed. Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Falcon-Mamba 7B, mixed projects and evidence-linked HTML/PDF are all first-delivery **P0**. Historical estimates below are not current staffing commitments; the single active developer follows Burkay → Cafer → Alperen Enes Yaman → İsmail → Taha Uğur Toyran. PR #38 is pre-Genesis bootstrap and was merged to `main` on Burkay Çakar's explicit approval (`5754ed6eeaeef0cce9bc46264c8baeddfb62f88c`). Burkay is the sole required approval authority; other reviewers are optional. See [TR SRS](SRS.md) and [EN SRS](SRS_EN.md).

# Development Roadmap — PROJECT GENESIS v2.0

**Status:** Owner-approved implementation roadmap; sequential execution IN_PROGRESS, native 34-task/69-edge graph VERIFIED, first two accepted rotation tasks F00-PLAN and F00-V0; current task F02-CONTRACT / #11 assigned to Alperen, implementation NOT_STARTED at inspected baseline. **Original planning date:** 2026-10-27. **Delivery target:** 2027-01-01, exact time UNKNOWN.

## Authority and ordering

Technical source: owner-supplied Master Architecture v2.0 and Step-by-Step Development Guide v2.0, [Turkish SRS](SRS.md), [English SRS](SRS_EN.md). Execution source: approved Genesis v2.0 and (after merge) v2.1 operational protocol. The 31 original tasks/54 native edges remain intact; the 34-task/69-edge live graph was independently verified. Historical date windows are nonbinding estimates, not proof of future feasibility.

Only ONE active implementation developer at a time: Burkay → Cafer → Alperen Enes Yaman → İsmail → Taha Uğur Toyran → repeat. Use the currently effective policy to authorize the registered task and verify its hard prerequisites. Current execution state is in `.github/task-plan.json#sequential_execution` and [project status](PROJECT_STATUS.md). The task registry and GitHub native issue edges govern dependencies.

**Scope elevation approved 2026-10-26:** Falcon-Mamba 7B (#19–#20), full PDF reports (#31), Python (#32), JavaScript/TypeScript (#33) and mixed language (#34) are first-delivery **P0** obligations. P1-only historical scheduling cannot defer them. C#, Go and C++ are mandatory first-delivery P0 under the 2026-10-27 owner decision. Each requires real adapter/source symbols, tests, coverage, safely validated patch E2E and release evidence. P0 may be implemented in dependency order, not concurrently. No unapproved scope change.

## Six research work packages (not developer assignments)

| Package | Focus | GitHub issue |
|---|---|---|
| İP1 | Experiment baseline and platform contracts | #2 |
| İP2 | Language adapters, initial quality and behavior measurement | #3 |
| İP3 | Deterministic security and mandatory Falcon-Mamba | #4 |
| İP4 | Approval 1, dependency-aware context and controlled patching | #5 |
| İP5 | Evidence-based validation, final version and reporting | #6 |
| İP6 | Mandatory multilingual expansion and empirical evaluation | #7 |

## Technical task registry and mandatory dependencies — revised 2026-10-27

**34 P0 tasks = 31 original + 3 additional (#40–#42).** The original 54 native dependency edges remain, with 15 added and the complete 69-edge native graph verified. Prerequisite acceptance is still checked separately for each next task; a dependency edge is not completion evidence.

**Added P0 work:** F14-CS/#40 Roslyn, F14-GO/#41 Go modules/types, F14-CPP/#42 Clang/native build. Each depends on F02-CONTRACT + F06-SANDBOX + F11-VALIDATE. **Release-critical joins:** F14-MIX/#34 waits for Python/JS/TS plus all three new adapters; F15-P0/#35 waits for F13-BASIC + F13-ADV + F07B-LOCAL + F14-MIX. The latter blocks the experiment and final hand-in through existing F15 dependencies.

**Important schedule constraint:** Several historic dates and effort estimates are infeasible to treat as confirmed after seven-language expansion and strictly sequential ownership. They remain archival planning values; a dependency-based reforecast and toolchain availability check are mandatory before confirming delivery feasibility.

## Milestone acceptance, not calendar completion

- **F00–F03:** Approved requirements and V0, reproducible environment, typed contracts, stable job state and safe input.
- **F04–F07B:** Real Java parser/quality/baseline/sandbox, deterministic security, Falcon-Mamba 7B measured local reviewer.
- **F08–F12:** Two user approvals, context and conflicts, real bounded cloud patch, independent and combined validation.
- **F13–F14:** Before/after dashboard, full HTML/PDF/history, verified Python/JS/TS/C#/Go/C++ and mixed-component capabilities.
- **F15:** E2E acceptance for all seven languages plus actual Falcon-Mamba, frozen failure-inclusive experiment, reproducible first delivery and release review.

Every milestone requires actual task output, focused and integration verification, inspected acceptance evidence and accepted handoff. GitHub CI for governance does not prove product implementation.

## Current transition and release risks

1. Historical transition: PR #38 and #39 have already been merged. Their former open/review requirements are no longer blockers. Current changes must satisfy current approval, CI and safe-merge policy.
2. Fixed assignees in live GitHub issues are historic/transition metadata; removal must be coordinated only after compatible gate and review policy is accepted, without issue or dependency deletion.
3. Both Turkish and English SRS v0.4 are explicitly approved by Burkay on 2026-10-27; do not confuse approval with verified software.
4. Actual local Falcon-Mamba GPU/runtime, C#/.NET, Go and C++/Clang toolchains, and patch-provider API/consent/budget are not verified.
5. New #40–#42 issues and all 69 native dependency edges have been synchronized and audited. Any new graph change must be separately authorized and verified; do not delete live dependencies merely to simplify planning.
6. New mandatory P0 scope may exceed the remaining capacity; schedule feasibility must be reassessed, not disguised by inaccurate progress percentages.

**Current authorized development (at audited `main` 3d43a94fbf494360dfec1e7fb852cc99100d51eb):** Alperen Enes Yaman / F02-CONTRACT / Issue #11, implementation NOT_STARTED; conditional next owner İsmail after accepted handoff. The accepted tasks F00-PLAN / #8 and F00-V0 / #9 remain historical evidence, not new assignments. Recheck GitHub on every resumed turn.

## Final planning acceptance (2026-10-27)
> **Historical snapshot (2026-10-27):** The following acceptance paragraph records decisions at that date. Statements that the 69-edge graph is pending or Burkay remains active are superseded by the live-state note at the top and subsequent accepted handoffs.

**Approved by:** Burkay Çakar. This roadmap defines all 34 mandatory implementation tasks across the existing six research work packages; every one is P0 and links to current functional/nonfunctional requirements. An audit of the task registry confirms **69 unique, valid directed prerequisite edges, zero missing task references, and no dependency cycle**. All 31 original issues and 54 original live edges are preserved. Exactly 15 new live prerequisite edges and three parent links remain subject to the gated graph synchronization and post-write audit. Start with active F00-PLAN (#8), owner Burkay. F01-GOV (#1) is pre-Genesis governance work, not a completed rotation or authorization to skip F00-PLAN. No second owner begins without accepted handoff.

**Planning capacity warning:** Current registry estimates sum to **436–666 person-hours** for the 34 tasks. These are historical/rough planning figures, NOT actual executed hours and NOT a credible 2027-01-01 completion forecast without staffing and runtime evidence. The one-active-owner rule prohibits parallel implementation; prioritize mandatory prerequisites and reforecast after the real baseline. No mandatory adapter, Falcon-Mamba, negative-path validation or final report can be silently deferred. The next Codex prompt is intentionally NOT generated by this plan-acceptance phase.

**Sole approval control:** Burkay posts `GENESIS-OWNER-APPROVED: <CURRENT_HEAD_SHA>` in the relevant PR conversation. Peer approvals are optional; checks, Git ancestry, immutable V0 and product acceptance still apply. Implementation readiness and release readiness remain `NOT_READY` until demonstrated.

## Confirmed rotation transition — 2026-11-02

Previous roadmap snapshots indicating F00-PLAN in progress or new native dependencies pending are historical. After successful full issue-graph audit, Burkay-approved PR #44 merged at `ac321cb43fdea3f6b64bb1631de8daca8cf1d229`; Issue #8 is completed, and `.github/acceptance.json` contains the verified exact-HEAD acceptance. **One rotation turn accepted**: Burkay → **Cafer**, now assigned **F00-V0 / #9**. Next owner Alperen is conditional, not authorized. No other task or requirement is thereby completed. Earlier estimated task dates do not establish executed work.

## F00-V0 accepted handoff and next assignment — 2026-11-04

Cafer explicitly accepted the bounded F00-V0 result and selected Alperen for
F02-CONTRACT / #11 in this chat. PR #45 source
`d923134da4f9f5a2ab55a5f51fbf9415ff717262` merged at
`fdd573286834fe15c1ac1c0d51db4ed9b0015db7`; exact delegated approval and real
PR/main checks are recorded in trusted acceptance #9. This consumes one Cafer
turn, index 1 → 2, keyed by that task/source pair. Current task is Alperen /
F02-CONTRACT; conditional successor is İsmail. The only hard prerequisite of
#11 remains #8; no graph edge or historical estimate was changed.
[Preparation-only handoff](handoffs/F00-V0-to-F02-CONTRACT.md) is supplied; no
next-task code or execution contract has been implemented. Earlier Cafer-active
notes are historical. Dataset NOT_FROZEN; research NOT_RUN; release NOT_READY.
